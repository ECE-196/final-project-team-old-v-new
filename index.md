## Problem: 
* Many snowboarders, particularly beginners, encounter injuries and struggle to identify areas for improvement on their own.

## Our Solution:
* A support system that alerts the user when their footing or form is improper. It informs the user on how to improve in real-time. 

### Project Overview

- This project aims to create a simple snowboard support system solution for safeguarding beginners. Our solution takes accelerometer input and exchange data with python through the ESP32 microcontroller.
