Ease up on the throttle, slow down and regain control!
Don't rush, find your rhythm and glide smoothly!
Lead with your knees, not your nose, and maintain balance!
Relax those legs, let them absorb the bumps!
Keep your knees bent and ready to adjust!
Don't lock those knees, keep them loose and flexible!
Stay smooth and steady, don't rush your turns!
Mind your speed, it's all about control!
Slow it down, keep your movements deliberate and precise!
Shoulders parallel with your board, stay aligned for stability!
Stay centered, don't let your shoulders lead the way!
Relax your upper body, let your legs do the work!
Keep those shoulders square, don't twist too much!
Balance is key, keep your weight evenly distributed!
Maintain a fluid motion, don't tense up!
Stay loose and relaxed, it's all about flow!
Keep your movements smooth and controlled!
Stay centered and focused, keep your eyes on the path ahead!
Glide with grace, don't force it!
Let the board do the work, just guide it with your movements!
