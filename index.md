## Problem: 
* Many snowboarders, particularly beginners, encounter injuries and struggle to identify areas for improvement on their own.

## Our Solution:
* A support system that alerts the user if their movement could lead to falling. It also informs the user on how to improve in real-time with tips about their footing, speed, and general control over the board.  

## Project Overview

- This project aims to create a simple snowboard support system solution for safeguarding beginners. Our solution takes accelerometer input and exchanges data with python through the ESP32 microcontroller and bluetooth.
